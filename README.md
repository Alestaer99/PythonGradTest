# Grad Tech Test - Python
## Alex Holley

## About Me

I have a background in Environmental Science in which I have had some training in python and SQL in the context of conducting geospatial data analysis in ArcGIS Pro. As I am a beginner, I have taught myself more python mainly using forums on Stack Exchange and W3 Schools for basic python syntax, with the hope to enter the software consultancy field. Please see my best efforts as a beginner from the test and I'm looking forward to your feedback!

## About the Test Script 

Please open medalsDone.py to view the test script. I have inserted notes '#' along with my code for the reader to follow how I approached this problem. Please see the 'createMedalTable' function which I have created as a solution to the Medal table task.
